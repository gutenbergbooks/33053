<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>This little volume really needs no introduction;
the two sketches of which it is
made explain and, I hope, justify themselves.
But there is one phase of the
President's many-sided character upon
which I should like to lay especial emphasis,
namely, his natural history bent
and knowledge. Amid all his absorbing
interests and masterful activities in other
fields, his interest and his authority in
practical natural history are by no means
the least. I long ago had very direct proof
of this statement. In some of my English
sketches, following a visit to that island
in 1882, I had, rather by implication than
by positive statement, inclined to the
opinion that the European forms of animal
life were, as a rule, larger and more
hardy and prolific than the corresponding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg viii]</a></span>
forms in this country. Roosevelt could
not let this statement or suggestion go
unchallenged, and the letter which I received
from him in 1892, touching these
things, is of double interest at this time,
as showing one phase of his radical
Americanism, while it exhibits him as a
thoroughgoing naturalist. I am sure my
readers will welcome the gist of this letter.
After some preliminary remarks he
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The point of which I am speaking
is where you say that the Old World
forms of animal life are coarser, stronger,
fiercer, and more fertile than those of the
New World." (My statement was not
quite so sweeping as this.) "Now I don't
think that this is so; at least, comparing
the forms which are typical of North
America and of northern Asia and
Europe, which together form but one
province of animal life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>"Many animals and birds which increase
very fast in new countries, and
which are commonly spoken of as European
in their origin, are really as alien
to Europe as to their new homes. Thus
the rabbit, rat, and mouse are just as
truly interlopers in England as in the
United States and Australia, having
moved thither apparently within historic
times, the rabbit from North Africa, the
others from southern Asia; and one could
no more generalize upon the comparative
weakness of the American fauna from
these cases of intruders than one could
generalize from them upon the comparative
weakness of the British, German,
and French wild animals. Our wood
mouse or deer mouse retreats before the
ordinary house mouse in exactly the same
way that the European wood mouse does,
and not a whit more. Our big wood rat
stands in the same relation to the house
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg x]</a></span>
rat. Casting aside these cases, it seems
to me, looking at the mammals, that it
would be quite impossible to generalize
as to whether those of the Old or the New
World are more fecund, are the fiercest,
the hardiest, or the strongest. A great
many cases could be cited on both sides.
Our moose and caribou are, in certain of
their varieties, rather larger than the Old
World forms of the same species. If
there is any difference between the beavers
of the two countries, it is in the same direction.
So with the great family of the
field mice. The largest true arvicola
seems to be the yellow-cheeked mouse of
Hudson's Bay, and the biggest representative
of the family on either continent is
the muskrat. In most of its varieties the
wolf of North America seems to be inferior
in strength and courage to that of
northern Europe and Asia; but the direct
reverse is true with the grizzly bear, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg xi]</a></span>
is merely a somewhat larger and fiercer
variety of the common European brown
bear. On the whole, the Old World bison,
or so-called aurochs, appears to be somewhat
more formidable than its American
brother; but the difference against the
latter is not anything like as great as the
difference in favor of the American wapiti,
which is nothing but a giant representative
of the comparatively puny European
stag. So with the red fox. The fox
of New York is about the size of that
of France, and inferior in size to that of
Scotland; the latter in turn is inferior in
size to the big fox of the upper Missouri,
while the largest of all comes from British
America. There is no basis for the belief
that the red fox was imported here from
Europe; its skin was a common article
of trade with the Canadian fur traders
from the earliest times. On the other
hand, the European lynx is much bigger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg xii]</a></span>
than the American. The weasels afford
cases in point, showing how hard it is to
make a general law on the subject. The
American badger is very much smaller
than the European, and the American
otter very much larger than the European
otter. Our pine marten, or sable, compared
with that of Europe, shows the
very qualities of which you speak; that
is, its skull is slenderer, the bones are
somewhat lighter, the teeth less stout, the
form showing more grace and less strength.
But curiously enough this is reversed,
with even greater emphasis, in the minks
of the two continents, the American being
much the largest and strongest, with
stouter teeth, bigger bones, and a stronger
animal in every way. The little weasel is
on the whole smaller here, while the big
weasel, or stoat, is, in some of its varieties
at least, largest on this side; and, of the
true weasels, the largest of all is the so-called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
fisher, a purely American beast, a
fierce and hardy animal which habitually
preys upon as hard fighting a creature as
the raccoon, and which could eat all the
Asiatic and European varieties of weasels
without an effort.</p>

<p>"About birds I should be far less competent
to advance arguments, and especially,
my dear sir, to you; but it seems
to me that two of the most self-asserting
and hardiest of our families of birds are
the tyrant flycatchers, of which the kingbird
is chief, and the blackbirds, or
grackles, with the meadow lark at their
head, both characteristically American.</p>

<p>"Did you ever look over the medical
statistics of the half million men drafted
during the Civil War? They include men
of every race and color, and from every
country of Europe, and from every State
in the Union; and so many men were
measured that the average of the measurements
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
is probably pretty fair. From
these it would appear that the physical
type in the Eastern States had undoubtedly
degenerated. The man from New
York or New England, unless he came
from the lumbering districts, though as
tall as the Englishman or Irishman, was
distinctly lighter built, and especially was
narrower across the chest; but the finest
men physically of all were the Kentuckians
and Tennesseeans. After them came
the Scandinavians, then the Scotch, then
the people from several of the Western
States, such as Wisconsin and Minnesota,
then the Irish, then the Germans, then
the English, etc. The decay of vitality,
especially as shown in the decreasing
fertility of the New England and, indeed,
New York stock, is very alarming; but
the most prolific peoples on this continent,
whether of native or foreign origin,
are the native whites of the southern
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg xv]</a></span>
Alleghany region in Kentucky and Tennessee,
the Virginians, and the Carolinians,
and also the French of Canada.</p>

<p>"It will be difficult to frame a general
law of fecundity in comparing the effects
upon human life of long residence on the
two continents when we see that the
Frenchman in Canada is healthy and
enormously fertile, while the old French
stock is at the stationary point in France,
the direct reverse being the case when
the English of Old and of New England
are compared, and the decision being
again reversed if we compare the English
with the mountain whites of the Southern
States."</p>

<h2>CAMPING WITH PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT</h2>


<p>At the time I made the trip to Yellowstone
Park with President Roosevelt in
the spring of 1903, I promised some
friends to write up my impressions of
the President and of the Park, but I have
been slow in getting around to it. The
President himself, having the absolute
leisure and peace of the White House,
wrote his account of the trip nearly two
years ago! But with the stress and strain
of my life at "Slabsides,"&mdash;administering
the affairs of so many of the wild
creatures of the woods about me,&mdash;I
have not till this blessed season (fall of
1905) found the time to put on record an
account of the most interesting thing I
saw in that wonderful land, which, of
course, was the President
himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>When I accepted his invitation I was
well aware that during the journey I
should be in a storm centre most of the
time, which is not always a pleasant
prospect to a man of my habits and disposition.
The President himself is a good
deal of a storm,&mdash;a man of such abounding
energy and ceaseless activity that he
sets everything in motion around him
wherever he goes. But I knew he would
be pretty well occupied on his way to the
Park in speaking to eager throngs and in
receiving personal and political homage
in the towns and cities we were to pass
through. But when all this was over, and
I found myself with him in the wilderness
of the Park, with only the superintendent
and a few attendants to help take
up his tremendous personal impact, how
was it likely to fare with a non-strenuous
person like myself? I asked. I had visions
of snow six and seven feet deep, where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 5]</a></span>
traveling could be done only upon snow-shoes,
and I had never had the things on
my feet in my life. If the infernal fires
beneath, that keep the pot boiling so
furiously in the Park, should melt the
snows, I could see the party tearing along
on horseback at a wolf-hunt pace over a
rough country; and as I had not been
on a horse's back since the President
was born, how would it be likely to fare
with me then?</p>

<p>I had known the President several
years before he became famous, and we
had had some correspondence on subjects
of natural history. His interest in such
themes is always very fresh and keen,
and the main motive of his visit to the
Park at this time was to see and study in
its semi-domesticated condition the great
game which he had so often hunted during
his ranch days; and he was kind
enough to think it would be an additional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 6]</a></span>
pleasure to see it with a nature-lover like
myself. For my own part, I knew nothing
about big game, but I knew there was no
man in the country with whom I should
so like to see it as Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Some of our newspapers reported that
the President intended to hunt in the
Park. A woman in Vermont wrote me,
to protest against the hunting, and hoped
I would teach the President to love the
animals as much as I did,&mdash;as if he did
not love them much more, because his
love is founded upon knowledge, and
because they had been a part of his life.
She did not know that I was then cherishing
the secret hope that I might be allowed
to shoot a cougar or bobcat; but
this fun did not come to me. The President
said, "I will not fire a gun in the
Park; then I shall have no explanations
to make." Yet once I did hear him say
in the wilderness, "I feel as if I ought to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 7]</a></span>
keep the camp in meat. I always have."
I regretted that he could not do so on this
occasion.</p>

<p>I have never been disturbed by the
President's hunting trips. It is to such
men as he that the big game legitimately
belongs,&mdash;men who regard it from the
point of view of the naturalist as well as
from that of the sportsman, who are interested
in its preservation, and who share
with the world the delight they experience
in the chase. Such a hunter as Roosevelt
is as far removed from the game-butcher
as day is from night; and as for his killing
of the "varmints,"&mdash;bears, cougars,
and bobcats,&mdash;the fewer of these there
are, the better for the useful and beautiful
game.</p>

<p>The cougars, or mountain lions, in the
Park certainly needed killing. The superintendent
reported that he had seen where
they had slain nineteen elk, and we saw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 8]</a></span>
where they had killed a deer and dragged
its body across the trail. Of course, the
President would not now on his hunting
trips shoot an elk or a deer except to
"keep the camp in meat," and for this
purpose it is as legitimate as to slay a
sheep or a steer for the table at home.</p>

<p>We left Washington on April 1, and
strung several of the larger Western cities
on our thread of travel,&mdash;Chicago, Milwaukee,
Madison, St. Paul, Minneapolis,&mdash;as
well as many lesser towns, in each
of which the President made an address,
sometimes brief, on a few occasions of an
hour or more.</p>

<p>He gave himself very freely and heartily
to the people wherever he went. He could
easily match their Western cordiality
and good-fellowship. Wherever his train
stopped, crowds soon gathered, or had
already gathered, to welcome him. His
advent made a holiday in each town he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 9]</a></span>
visited. At all the principal stops the
usual programme was: first, his reception
by the committee of citizens appointed to
receive him,&mdash;they usually boarded his
private car, and were one by one introduced
to him; then a drive through the
town with a concourse of carriages; then
to the hall or open-air platform, where
he spoke to the assembled throng; then
to lunch or dinner; and then back to the
train, and off for the next stop,&mdash;a round
of hand-shaking, carriage-driving, speech-making
each day. He usually spoke
from eight to ten times every twenty-four
hours, sometimes for only a few minutes
from the rear platform of his private car,
at others for an hour or more in some
large hall. In Chicago, Milwaukee, and
St. Paul, elaborate banquets were given
him and his party, and on each occasion
he delivered a carefully prepared speech
upon questions that involved the policy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of his administration. The throng that
greeted him in the vast Auditorium in
Chicago&mdash;that rose and waved and
waved again&mdash;was one of the grandest
human spectacles I ever witnessed.</p>

<p>In Milwaukee the dense cloud of tobacco
smoke that presently filled the
large hall after the feasting was over was
enough to choke any speaker, but it did
not seem to choke the President, though
he does not use tobacco in any form himself;
nor was there anything foggy about
his utterances on that occasion upon
legislative control of the trusts.</p>

</div>

<p>In St. Paul the city was inundated
with humanity,&mdash;a vast human tide
that left the middle of the streets bare as
our line of carriages moved slowly along,
but that rose up in solid walls of town
and prairie humanity on the sidewalks
and city dooryards. How hearty and
happy the myriad faces looked! At one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 11]</a></span>
point I spied in the throng on the curbstone
a large silk banner that bore my
own name as the title of some society. I
presently saw that it was borne by half
a dozen anxious and expectant-looking
schoolgirls with braids down their backs.
As my carriage drew near them, they
pressed their way through the throng
and threw a large bouquet of flowers into
my lap. I think it would be hard to say
who blushed the deeper, the girls or myself.
It was the first time I had ever had
flowers showered upon me in public; and
then, maybe, I felt that on such an occasion
I was only a minor side issue, and
public recognition was not called for.
But the incident pleased the President.
"I saw that banner and those flowers," he
said afterwards; "and I was delighted to
see you honored that way." But I fear I
have not to this day thanked the Monroe
School of St. Paul for that pretty
attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The time of the passing of the presidential
train seemed well known, even
on the Dakota prairies. At one point I
remember a little brown schoolhouse
stood not far off, and near the track the
school-ma'am, with her flock, drawn up
in line. We were at luncheon, but the
President caught a glimpse ahead through
the window, and quickly took in the
situation. With napkin in hand, he
rushed out on the platform and waved to
them. "Those children," he said, as he
came back, "wanted to see the President
of the United States, and I could not disappoint
them. They may never have
another chance. What a deep impression
such things make when we are young!"</p>

<p>At some point in the Dakotas we picked
up the former foreman of his ranch and
another cowboy friend of the old days,
and they rode with the President in his
private car for several hours. He was as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 13]</a></span>
happy with them as a schoolboy ever was
in meeting old chums. He beamed with
delight all over. The life which those
men represented, and of which he had
himself once formed a part, meant so
much to him; it had entered into the very
marrow of his being, and I could see the
joy of it all shining in his face as he sat
and lived parts of it over again with those
men that day. He bubbled with laughter
continually. The men, I thought, seemed
a little embarrassed by his open-handed
cordiality and good-fellowship. He himself
evidently wanted to forget the present,
and to live only in the memory of those
wonderful ranch days,&mdash;that free, hardy,
adventurous life upon the plains. It all
came back to him with a rush when he
found himself alone with these heroes of
the rope and the stirrup. How much
more keen his appreciation was, and how
much quicker his memory, than theirs!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 14]</a></span>
He was constantly recalling to their
minds incidents which they had forgotten,
and the names of horses and dogs which
had escaped them. His subsequent life,
instead of making dim the memory of his
ranch days, seemed to have made it more
vivid by contrast.</p>

<p>When they had gone I said to him, "I
think your affection for those men very
beautiful."</p>

<p>"How could I help it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Still, few men in your station could
or would go back and renew such friendships."</p>

<p>"Then I pity them," he replied.</p>

<p>He said afterwards that his ranch life
had been the making of him. It had
built him up and hardened him physically,
and it had opened his eyes to the
wealth of manly character among the
plainsmen and cattlemen.</p>

<p>Had he not gone West, he said, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 15]</a></span>
never would have raised the Rough Riders
regiment; and had he not raised that
regiment and gone to the Cuban War, he
would not have been made governor of
New York; and had not this happened,
the politicians would not unwittingly
have made his rise to the Presidency so
inevitable. There is no doubt, I think,
that he would have got there some day;
but without the chain of events above
outlined, his rise could not have been so
rapid.</p>

<p>Our train entered the Bad Lands of
North Dakota in the early evening twilight,
and the President stood on the rear
platform of his car, gazing wistfully upon
the scene. "I know all this country like a
book," he said. "I have ridden over it,
and hunted over it, and tramped over it,
in all seasons and weather, and it looks
like home to me. My old ranch is not
far off. We shall soon reach Medora,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 16]</a></span>
which was my station." It was plain to
see that that strange, forbidding-looking
landscape, hills and valleys to eastern
eyes, utterly demoralized and gone to the
bad,&mdash;flayed, fantastic, treeless, a riot
of naked clay slopes, chimney-like buttes,
and dry coulees,&mdash;was in his eyes a land
of almost pathetic interest. There were
streaks of good pasturage here and there
where his cattle used to graze, and where
the deer and the pronghorn used to
linger.</p>

<p>When we reached Medora, where the
train was scheduled to stop an hour, it
was nearly dark, but the whole town and
country round had turned out to welcome
their old townsman. After much hand-shaking,
the committee conducted us
down to a little hall, where the President
stood on a low platform, and made a
short address to the standing crowd that
filled the place. Then some flashlight pictures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 17]</a></span>
were taken by the local photographer,
after which the President stepped
down, and, while the people filed past
him, shook hands with every man, woman,
and child of them, calling many of
them by name, and greeting them all
most cordially. I recall one grizzled old
frontiersman whose hand he grasped,
calling him by name, and saying, "How
well I remember you! You once mended
my gunlock for me,&mdash;put on a new
hammer." "Yes," said the delighted old
fellow; "I'm the man, Mr. President."
He was among his old neighbors once
more, and the pleasure of the meeting
was very obvious on both sides. I heard
one of the women tell him they were going
to have a dance presently, and ask him
if he would not stay and open it! The
President laughingly excused himself, and
said his train had to leave on schedule
time, and his time was nearly up. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 18]</a></span>
thought of the incident in his "Ranch
Life," in which he says he once opened a
cowboy ball with the wife of a Minnesota
man, who danced opposite, and who had
recently shot a bullying Scotchman. He
says the scene reminded him of the ball
where Bret Harte's heroine "went down
the middle with the man that shot Sandy
Magee."</p>

<p>Before reaching Medora he had told
me many anecdotes of "Hell-Roaring
Bill Jones," and had said I should see
him. But it turned out that Hell-Roaring
Bill had begun to celebrate the coming of
the President too early in the day, and
when we reached Medora he was not in a
presentable condition. I forget now how
he had earned his name, but no doubt he
had come honestly by it; it was a part of
his history, as was that of "The Pike,"
"Cold-Turkey Bill," "Hash-Knife Joe,"
and other classic heroes of the
frontier.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>It is curious how certain things go to
the bad in the Far West, or a certain proportion
of them,&mdash;bad lands, bad horses,
and bad men. And it is a degree of badness
that the East has no conception of,&mdash;land
that looks as raw and unnatural
as if time had never laid its shaping and
softening hand upon it; horses that, when
mounted, put their heads to the ground
and their heels in the air, and, squealing
defiantly, resort to the most diabolically
ingenious tricks to shake off or to kill
their riders; and men who amuse themselves
in bar-rooms by shooting about
the feet of a "tenderfoot" to make him
dance, or who ride along the street and
shoot at every one in sight. Just as the
old plutonic fires come to the surface out
there in the Rockies, and hint very
strongly of the infernal regions, so a kind
of satanic element in men and animals&mdash;an
underlying devilishness&mdash;crops
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 20]</a></span>
out, and we have the border ruffian and
the bucking broncho.</p>

<p>The President told of an Englishman
on a hunting trip in the West, who, being
an expert horseman at home, scorned the
idea that he could not ride any of their
"grass-fed ponies." So they gave him a
bucking broncho. He was soon lying on
the ground, much stunned. When he
could speak, he said, "I should not have
minded him, you know, <i>but 'e 'ides 'is
'ead</i>."</p>

<p>At one place in Dakota the train stopped
to take water while we were at lunch. A
crowd soon gathered, and the President
went out to greet them. We could hear
his voice, and the cheers and laughter of
the crowd. And then we heard him say,
"Well, good-by, I must go now." Still
he did not come. Then we heard more
talking and laughing, and another "good-by,"
and yet he did not come. Then I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 21]</a></span>
went out to see what had happened. I
found the President down on the ground
shaking hands with the whole lot of them.
Some one had reached up to shake his
hand as he was about withdrawing, and
this had been followed by such eagerness
on the part of the rest of the people to do
likewise, that the President had instantly
got down to gratify them. Had the secret
service men known it, they would have
been in a pickle. We probably have never
had a President who responded more
freely and heartily to the popular liking
for him than Roosevelt. The crowd always
seem to be in love with him the
moment they see him and hear his voice.
And it is not by reason of any arts of eloquence,
or charm of address, but by reason
of his inborn heartiness and sincerity,
and his genuine manliness. The people
feel his quality at once. In Bermuda last
winter I met a Catholic priest who had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 22]</a></span>
sat on the platform at some place in New
England very near the President while
he was speaking, and who said, "The
man had not spoken three minutes before
I loved him, and had any one tried to
molest him, I could have torn him to
pieces." It is the quality in the man that
instantly inspires such a liking as this in
strangers that will, I am sure, safeguard
him in all public places.</p>

<p>I once heard him say that he did not
like to be addressed as "His Excellency;"
he added laughingly, "They might just
as well call me 'His Transparency,' for all
I care." It is this transparency, this direct
out-and-out, unequivocal character of
him that is one source of his popularity.
The people do love transparency,&mdash;all
of them but the politicians.</p>

<p>A friend of his one day took him to
task for some mistake he had made in one
of his appointments. "My dear sir,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 23]</a></span>
replied the President, "where you know
of one mistake I have made, I know of
ten." How such candor must make the
politicians shiver!</p>

<p>I have said that I stood in dread of the
necessity of snowshoeing in the Park,
and, in lieu of that, of horseback riding.
Yet when we reached Gardiner, the entrance
to the Park, on that bright, crisp
April morning, with no snow in sight save
that on the mountain-tops, and found
Major Pitcher and Captain Chittenden
at the head of a squad of soldiers, with a
fine saddle-horse for the President, and
an ambulance drawn by two span of
mules for me, I confess that I experienced
just a slight shade of mortification. I
thought they might have given me the
option of the saddle or the ambulance.
Yet I entered the vehicle as if it was just
what I had been expecting.</p>

<p>The President and his escort, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 24]</a></span>
cloud of cowboys hovering in the rear,
were soon off at a lively pace, and my
ambulance followed close, and at a lively
pace, too; so lively that I soon found myself
gripping the seat with both hands.
"Well," I said to myself, "they are giving
me a regular Western send-off;" and I
thought, as the ambulance swayed from
side to side, that it would suit me just as
well if my driver did not try to keep up
with the presidential procession. The
driver and his mules were shut off from
me by a curtain, but, looking ahead out
of the sides of the vehicle, I saw two good-sized
logs lying across our course. Surely,
I thought (and barely had time to think),
he will avoid these. But he did not, and
as we passed over them I was nearly
thrown through the top of the ambulance.
"This <i>is</i> a lively send-off," I said, rubbing
my bruises with one hand, while I clung
to the seat with the other. Presently I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 25]</a></span>
saw the cowboys scrambling up the bank
as if to get out of our way; then the President
on his fine gray stallion scrambling
up the bank with his escort, and looking
ominously in my direction, as we thundered
by.</p>

</div>

<p>"Well," I said, "this is indeed a novel
ride; for once in my life I have sidetracked
the President of the United
States! I am given the right of way over
all." On we tore, along the smooth, hard
road, and did not slacken our pace till,
at the end of a mile or two, we began to
mount the hill toward Fort Yellowstone.
And not till we reached the fort did I
learn that our mules had run away. They
had been excited beyond control by the
presidential cavalcade, and the driver,
finding he could not hold them, had
aimed only to keep them in the road,
and we very soon had the road all to
ourselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Fort Yellowstone is at Mammoth Hot
Springs, where one gets his first view of
the characteristic scenery of the Park,&mdash;huge,
boiling springs with their columns
of vapor, and the first characteristic odors
which suggest the traditional infernal
regions quite as much as the boiling and
steaming water does. One also gets a
taste of a much more rarefied air than he
has been used to, and finds himself panting
for breath on a very slight exertion.
The Mammoth Hot Springs have built
themselves up an enormous mound that
stands there above the village on the side
of the mountain, terraced and scalloped
and fluted, and suggesting some vitreous
formation, or rare carving of enormous,
many-colored precious stones. It looks
quite unearthly, and, though the devil's
frying pan, and ink pot, and the Stygian
caves are not far off, the suggestion is of
something celestial rather than of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 27]</a></span>
nether regions,&mdash;a vision of jasper walls,
and of amethyst battlements.</p>

<p>With Captain Chittenden I climbed to
the top, stepping over the rills and creeks
of steaming hot water, and looked at the
marvelously clear, cerulean, but boiling,
pools on the summit. The water seemed
as unearthly in its beauty and purity as
the gigantic sculpturing that held it.</p>

<p>The Stygian caves are still farther up
the mountain,&mdash;little pockets in the
rocks, or well-holes in the ground at your
feet, filled with deadly carbon dioxide.
We saw birds' feathers and quills in all of
them. The birds hop into them, probably
in quest of food or seeking shelter,
and they never come out. We saw the
body of a martin on the bank of one hole.
Into one we sank a lighted torch, and it
was extinguished as quickly as if we had
dropped it into water. Each cave or niche
is a death valley on a small scale. Near by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 28]</a></span>
we came upon a steaming pool, or lakelet,
of an acre or more in extent. A pair of
mallard ducks were swimming about in
one end of it,&mdash;the cool end. When we
approached, they swam slowly over into
the warmer water. As they progressed,
the water got hotter and hotter, and the
ducks' discomfort was evident. Presently
they stopped, and turned towards us,
half appealingly, as I thought. They
could go no farther; would we please
come no nearer? As I took another step
or two, up they rose and disappeared
over the hill. Had they gone to the extreme
end of the pool, we could have had
boiled mallard for dinner.</p>

<p>Another novel spectacle was at night,
or near sundown, when the deer came
down from the hills into the streets and
ate hay, a few yards from the officers'
quarters, as unconcernedly as so many
domestic sheep. This they had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 29]</a></span>
doing all winter, and they kept it up
till May, at times a score or more of
them profiting thus on the government's
bounty. When the sundown gun was
fired a couple of hundred yards away,
they gave a nervous start, but kept on
with their feeding. The antelope and elk
and mountain sheep had not yet grown
bold enough to accept Uncle Sam's charity
in that way.</p>

<p>The President wanted all the freedom
and solitude possible while in the Park,
so all newspaper men and other strangers
were excluded. Even the secret service
men and his physician and private secretaries
were left at Gardiner. He craved
once more to be alone with nature; he
was evidently hungry for the wild and
the aboriginal,&mdash;a hunger that seems to
come upon him regularly at least once a
year, and drives him forth on his hunting
trips for big game in the West.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>We spent two weeks in the Park, and
had fair weather, bright, crisp days, and
clear, freezing nights. The first week
we occupied three camps that had been
prepared, or partly prepared, for us in
the northeast corner of the Park, in the
region drained by the Gardiner River,
where there was but little snow, and
which we reached on horseback.</p>

<p>The second week we visited the geyser
region, which lies a thousand feet or more
higher, and where the snow was still five
or six feet deep. This part of the journey
was made in big sleighs, each drawn by
two span of horses.</p>

<p>On the horseback excursion, which
involved only about fifty miles of riding,
we had a mule pack train, and Sibley
tents and stoves, with quite a retinue of
camp laborers, a lieutenant and an orderly
or two, and a guide, Billy Hofer.</p>

<p>The first camp was in a wild, rocky,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 31]</a></span>
and picturesque gorge on the Yellowstone,
about ten miles from the fort. A
slight indisposition, the result of luxurious
living, with no wood to chop or to saw,
and no hills to climb, as at home, prevented
me from joining the party till the
third day. Then Captain Chittenden
drove me eight miles in a buggy. About
two miles from camp we came to a picket
of two or three soldiers, where my big
bay was in waiting for me. I mounted
him confidently, and, guided by an orderly,
took the narrow, winding trail
toward camp. Except for an hour's riding
the day before with Captain Chittenden,
I had not been on a horse's back for
nearly fifty years, and I had not spent as
much as a day in the saddle during my
youth. That first sense of a live, spirited,
powerful animal beneath you, at whose
mercy you are,&mdash;you, a pedestrian all
your days,&mdash;with gullies and rocks and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 32]</a></span>
logs to cross, and deep chasms opening
close beside you, is not a little disturbing.
But my big bay did his part well, and I
did not lose my head or my nerve, as we
cautiously made our way along the narrow
path on the side of the steep gorge,
with a foaming torrent rushing along at
its foot, nor yet when we forded the rocky
and rapid Yellowstone. A misstep or a
stumble on the part of my steed, and
probably the first bubble of my confidence
would have been shivered at once; but
this did not happen, and in due time we
reached the group of tents that formed
the President's camp.</p>

<p>The situation was delightful,&mdash;no
snow, scattered pine trees, a secluded
valley, rocky heights, and the clear,
ample, trouty waters of the Yellowstone.
The President was not in camp. In the
morning he had stated his wish to go
alone into the wilderness. Major Pitcher
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 33]</a></span>
very naturally did not quite like the idea,
and wished to send an orderly with him.</p>

<p>"No," said the President. "Put me
up a lunch, and let me go alone. I will
surely come back."</p>

<p>And back he surely came. It was
about five o'clock when he came briskly
down the path from the east to the camp.
It came out that he had tramped about
eighteen miles through a very rough
country. The day before, he and the
major had located a band of several hundred
elk on a broad, treeless hillside, and
his purpose was to find those elk, and
creep up on them, and eat his lunch
under their very noses. And this he did,
spending an hour or more within fifty
yards of them. He came back looking as
fresh as when he started, and at night,
sitting before the big camp fire, related
his adventure, and talked with his usual
emphasis and copiousness of many things.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 34]</a></span>
He told me of the birds he had seen or
heard; among them he had heard one
that was new to him. From his description
I told him I thought it was Townsend's
solitaire, a bird I much wanted to
see and hear. I had heard the West India
solitaire,&mdash;one of the most impressive
songsters I ever heard,&mdash;and I wished
to compare our Western form with it.</p>

<p>The next morning we set out for our
second camp, ten or a dozen miles away,
and in reaching it passed over much of
the ground the President had traversed
the day before. As we came to a wild,
rocky place above a deep chasm of the
river, with a few scattered pine trees, the
President said, "It was right here that I
heard that strange bird song." We paused
a moment. "And there it is now!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was the solitaire
singing from the top of a small cedar,&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 35]</a></span>
bright, animated, eloquent song, but
without the richness and magic of the
song of the tropical species. We hitched
our horses, and followed the bird up as it
flew from tree to tree. The President was
as eager to see and hear it as I was. It
seemed very shy, and we only caught
glimpses of it. In form and color it much
resembles its West India cousin, and
suggests our catbird. It ceased to sing
when we pursued it. It is a bird found
only in the wilder and higher parts of the
Rockies. My impression was that its
song did not quite merit the encomiums
that have been pronounced upon it.</p>

<p>At this point, I saw amid the rocks my
first and only Rocky Mountain woodchucks,
and, soon after we had resumed
our journey, our first blue grouse,&mdash;a
number of them like larger partridges.
Occasionally we would come upon black-tailed
deer, standing or lying down in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 36]</a></span>
bushes, their large ears at attention being
the first thing to catch the eye. They
would often allow us to pass within a few
rods of them without showing alarm.
Elk horns were scattered all over this
part of the Park, and we passed several
old carcasses of dead elk that had probably
died a natural death.</p>

<p>In a grassy bottom at the foot of a
steep hill, while the President and I were
dismounted, and noting the pleasing
picture which our pack train of fifteen or
twenty mules made filing along the side
of a steep grassy slope,&mdash;a picture which
he has preserved in his late volume, "Out-Door
Pastimes of an American Hunter,"&mdash;our
attention was attracted by plaintive,
musical, bird-like chirps that rose
from the grass about us. I was almost
certain it was made by a bird; the President
was of like opinion; and we kicked
about in the tufts of grass, hoping to flush
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the bird. Now here, now there, arose
this sharp, but bird-like note. Finally,
we found that it was made by a species of
gopher, whose holes we soon discovered.
What its specific name is I do not
know, but it should be called the singing
gopher.</p>

<p>Our destination this day was a camp
on Cottonwood Creek, near "Hell-Roaring
Creek." As we made our way in the
afternoon along a broad, open, grassy
valley, I saw a horseman come galloping
over the hill to our right, starting up a
band of elk as he came; riding across the
plain, he wheeled his horse, and, with the
military salute, joined our party. He
proved to be a government scout, called
the "Duke of Hell Roaring,"&mdash;an educated
officer from the Austrian army,
who, for some unknown reason, had exiled
himself here in this out-of-the-way
part of the world. He was a man in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 38]</a></span>
prime, of fine, military look and bearing.
After conversing a few moments with
the President and Major Pitcher, he rode
rapidly away.</p>

<p>Our second camp, which we reached in
mid-afternoon, was in the edge of the
woods on the banks of a fine, large trout
stream, where ice and snow still lingered
in patches. I tried for trout in the head of
a large, partly open pool, but did not get
a rise; too much ice in the stream, I concluded.
Very soon my attention was attracted
by a strange note, or call, in the
spruce woods. The President had also
noticed it, and, with me, wondered what
made it. Was it bird or beast? Billy
Hofer said he thought it was an owl, but
the sound in no way suggested an owl,
and the sun was shining brightly. It was
a sound such as a boy might make by
blowing in the neck of an empty bottle.
Presently we heard it beyond us on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 39]</a></span>
other side of the creek, which was pretty
good proof that the creature had wings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 648px;">

<span class="caption"><big>THE PRESIDENT IN THE BEAR COUNTRY</big><br />

</div>

<p>"Let's go run that bird down," said
the President to me.</p>

<p>So off we started across a small, open,
snow-streaked plain, toward the woods
beyond it. We soon decided that the bird
was on the top of one of a group of tall
spruces. After much skipping about over
logs and rocks, and much craning of our
necks, we made him out on the peak of
a spruce. I imitated his call, when he
turned his head down toward us, but we
could not make out what he was.</p>

<p>"Why did we not think to bring the
glasses?" said the President.</p>

<p>"I will run and get them," I replied.</p>

<p>"No," said he, "you stay here and keep
that bird treed, and I will fetch them."</p>

<p>So off he went like a boy, and was very
soon back with the glasses. We quickly
made out that it was indeed an owl,&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 40]</a></span>
pigmy owl, as it turned out,&mdash;not
much larger than a bluebird. I think the
President was as pleased as if we had
bagged some big game. He had never
seen the bird before.</p>

<p>Throughout the trip I found his interest
in bird life very keen, and his eye and
ear remarkably quick. He usually saw
the bird or heard its note as quickly as I
did,&mdash;and I had nothing else to think
about, and had been teaching my eye and
ear the trick of it for over fifty years. Of
course, his training as a big-game hunter
stood him in good stead, but back of that
were his naturalist's instincts, and his
genuine love of all forms of wild life.</p>

<p>I have been told that his ambition up to
the time he went to Harvard had been to
be a naturalist, but that there they seem
to have convinced him that all the out-of-door
worlds of natural history had been
conquered, and that the only worlds remaining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 41]</a></span>
were in the laboratory, and to be
won with the microscope and the scalpel.
But Roosevelt was a man made for action
in a wide field, and laboratory conquests
could not satisfy him. His instincts as a
naturalist, however, lie back of all his
hunting expeditions, and, in a large measure,
I think, prompt them. Certain it is
that his hunting records contain more live
natural history than any similar records
known to me, unless it be those of Charles
St. John, the Scotch naturalist-sportsman.</p>

<p>The Canada jays, or camp-robbers, as
they are often called, soon found out our
camp that afternoon, and no sooner had
the cook begun to throw out peelings and
scraps and crusts than the jays began to
carry them off, not to eat, as I observed,
but to hide them in the thicker branches
of the spruce trees. How tame they were,
coming within three or four yards of one!
Why this species of jay should everywhere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 42]</a></span>
be so familiar, and all other kinds so wild,
is a puzzle.</p>

<p>In the morning, as we rode down the
valley toward our next camping-place, at
Tower Falls, a band of elk containing a
hundred or more started along the side of
the hill a few hundred yards away. I was
some distance behind the rest of the party,
as usual, when I saw the President wheel
his horse off to the left, and, beckoning to
me to follow, start at a tearing pace on the
trail of the fleeing elk. He afterwards told
me that he wanted me to get a good view
of those elk at close range, and he was
afraid that if he sent the major or Hofer
to lead me, I would not get it. I hurried
along as fast as I could, which was not
fast; the way was rough,&mdash;logs, rocks,
spring runs, and a tenderfoot rider.</p>

<p>Now and then the President, looking
back and seeing what slow progress I was
making, would beckon to me impatiently,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and I could fancy him saying, "If I had
a rope around him, he would come faster
than that!" Once or twice I lost sight of
both him and the elk; the altitude was
great, and the horse was laboring like a
steam engine on an upgrade. Still I urged
him on. Presently, as I broke over a hill,
I saw the President pressing the elk up
the opposite slope. At the brow of the
hill he stopped, and I soon joined him.
There on the top, not fifty yards away,
stood the elk in a mass, their heads toward
us and their tongues hanging out.
They could run no farther. The President
laughed like a boy. The spectacle meant
much more to him than it did to me. I had
never seen a wild elk till on this trip, but
they had been among the notable game
that he had hunted. He had traveled
hundreds of miles, and undergone great
hardships, to get within rifle range of
these creatures. Now here stood scores
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of them with lolling tongues, begging for
mercy.</p>

<p>After gazing at them to our hearts' content,
we turned away to look up our companions,
who were nowhere within sight.
We finally spied them a mile or more away,
and, joining them, all made our way to
an elevated plateau that commanded an
open landscape three or four miles across.
It was high noon, and the sun shone clear
and warm. From this lookout we saw
herds upon herds of elk scattered over
the slopes and gentle valleys in front of
us. Some were grazing, some were standing
or lying upon the ground, or upon the
patches of snow. Through our glasses we
counted the separate bands, and then the
numbers of some of the bands or groups,
and estimated that three thousand elk
were in full view in the landscape around
us. It was a notable spectacle. Afterward,
in Montana, I attended a council of Indian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 45]</a></span>
chiefs at one of the Indian agencies,
and told them, through their interpreter,
that I had been with the Great Chief in
the Park, and of the game we had seen.
When I told them of these three thousand
elk all in view at once, they grunted
loudly, whether with satisfaction or with
incredulity, I could not tell.</p>

<p>In the midst of this great game amphitheatre
we dismounted and enjoyed the
prospect. And the President did an unusual
thing, he loafed for nearly an hour,&mdash;stretched
himself out in the sunshine
upon a flat rock, as did the rest of us, and,
I hope, got a few winks of sleep. I am
sure I did. Little, slender, striped chipmunks,
about half the size of ours, were
scurrying about; but I recall no other wild
things save the elk.</p>

<p>From here we rode down the valley to
our third camp, at Tower Falls, stopping
on the way to eat our luncheon on a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 46]</a></span>
washed boulder beside a creek. On this
ride I saw my first and only badger; he
stuck his striped head out of his hole in
the ground only a few yards away from
us as we passed.</p>

<p>Our camp at Tower Falls was amid
the spruces above a ca&ntilde;on of the Yellowstone,
five or six hundred feet deep. It
was a beautiful and impressive situation,&mdash;shelter,
snugness, even cosiness, looking
over the brink of the awful and
the terrifying. With a run and a jump I
think one might have landed in the river
at the bottom of the great abyss, and in
doing so might have scaled one of those
natural obelisks or needles of rock that
stand up out of the depths two or three
hundred feet high. Nature shows you
what an enormous furrow her plough can
open through the strata when moving
horizontally, at the same time that she
shows you what delicate and graceful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 47]</a></span>
columns her slower and gentler aerial
forces can carve out of the piled strata.
At the Falls there were two or three of
these columns, like the picket-pins of the
elder gods.</p>

<p>Across the ca&ntilde;on in front of our camp,
upon a grassy plateau which was faced
by a wall of trap rock, apparently thirty
or forty feet high, a band of mountain
sheep soon attracted our attention. They
were within long rifle range, but were not
at all disturbed by our presence, nor had
they been disturbed by the road-builders
who, under Captain Chittenden, were
constructing a government road along
the brink of the ca&ntilde;on. We speculated
as to whether or not the sheep could get
down the almost perpendicular face of
the chasm to the river to drink. It seemed
to me impossible. Would they try it while
we were there to see? We all hoped so;
and sure enough, late in the afternoon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the word came to our tents that the sheep
were coming down. The President, with
coat off and a towel around his neck, was
shaving. One side of his face was half
shaved, and the other side lathered. Hofer
and I started for a point on the brink of the
ca&ntilde;on where we could have a better view.</p>

<p>"By Jove," said the President, "I
must see that. The shaving can wait, and
the sheep won't."</p>

<p>So on he came, accoutred as he was,&mdash;coatless,
hatless, but not latherless, nor
towelless. Like the rest of us, his only
thought was to see those sheep do their
"stunt." With glasses in hand, we watched
them descend those perilous heights, leaping
from point to point, finding a foothold
where none appeared to our eyes, loosening
fragments of the crumbling rocks as
they came, now poised upon some narrow
shelf and preparing for the next leap, zig-zagging
or plunging straight down till the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 49]</a></span>
bottom was reached, and not one accident
or misstep amid all that insecure footing.
I think the President was the most pleased
of us all; he laughed with the delight of it,
and quite forgot his need of a hat and coat
till I sent for them.</p>

<p>In the night we heard the sheep going
back; we could tell by the noise of the
falling stones. In the morning I confidently
expected to see some of them lying
dead at the foot of the cliffs, but there
they all were at the top once more, apparently
safe and sound. They do, however,
occasionally meet with accidents in
their perilous climbing, and their dead
bodies have been found at the foot of the
rocks. Doubtless some point of rock to
which they had trusted gave way, and
crushed them in the descent, or fell upon
those in the lead.</p>

<p>The next day, while the rest of us went
fishing for trout in the Yellowstone, three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 50]</a></span>
or four miles above the camp, over the
roughest trail that we had yet traversed
on horseback, the President, who never
fishes unless put to it for meat, went off
alone again with his lunch in his pocket,
to stalk those sheep as he had stalked the
elk, and to feel the old sportsman's thrill
without the use of firearms. To do this
involved a tramp of eight or ten miles
down the river to a bridge and up the
opposite bank. This he did, and ate his
lunch near the sheep, and was back in
camp before we were.</p>

<p>We took some large cut-throat trout,
as they are called, from the yellow mark
across their throats, and I saw at short
range a black-tailed deer bounding along
in that curious, stiff-legged, mechanical,
yet springy manner, apparently all four
legs in the air at once, and all four feet
reaching the ground at once, affording a
very singular spectacle.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 51]</a></span>
We spent two nights in our Tower Falls
camp, and on the morning of the third
day set out on our return to Fort Yellowstone,
pausing at Yancey's on our way,
and exchanging greetings with the old
frontiersman, who died a few weeks later.</p>

<p>While in camp we always had a big fire
at night in the open near the tents, and
around this we sat upon logs or camp-stools,
and listened to the President's talk.
What a stream of it he poured forth! and
what a varied and picturesque stream!&mdash;anecdote,
history, science, politics, adventure,
literature; bits of his experience
as a ranchman, hunter, Rough Rider,
legislator, civil service commissioner, police
commissioner, governor, president,&mdash;the
frankest confessions, the most telling
criticisms, happy characterizations
of prominent political leaders, or foreign
rulers, or members of his own Cabinet;
always surprising by his candor, astonishing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 52]</a></span>
by his memory, and diverting by
his humor. His reading has been very
wide, and he has that rare type of memory
which retains details as well as mass
and generalities. One night something
started him off on ancient history, and
one would have thought he was just fresh
from his college course in history, the dates
and names and events came so readily.
Another time he discussed pal&aelig;ontology,
and rapidly gave the outlines of the science,
and the main facts, as if he had been reading
up on the subject that very day. He
sees things as wholes, and hence the relation
of the parts comes easy to him.</p>

<p>At dinner, at the White House, the
night before we started on the expedition,
I heard him talking with a guest,&mdash;an
officer of the British army, who was just
back from India. And the extent and variety
of his information about India and
Indian history and the relations of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 53]</a></span>
British government to it were extraordinary.
It put the British major on his
mettle to keep pace with him.</p>

<p>One night in camp he told us the story
of one of his Rough Riders who had just
written him from some place in Arizona.
The Rough Riders, wherever they are
now, look to him in time of trouble. This
one had come to grief in Arizona. He was
in jail. So he wrote the President, and
his letter ran something like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Colonel</span>,&mdash;I am in trouble.
I shot a lady in the eye, but I did not intend
to hit the lady; I was shooting at my
wife."</p></div>

<p>And the presidential laughter rang out
over the tree-tops. To another Rough
Rider, who was in jail, accused of horse
stealing, he had loaned two hundred
dollars to pay counsel on his trial, and,
to his surprise, in due time the money
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 54]</a></span>
came back. The ex-Rough wrote that his
trial never came off. "<i>We elected our district
attorney</i>;" and the laughter again
sounded, and drowned the noise of the
brook near by.</p>

<p>On another occasion we asked the President
if he was ever molested by any of
the "bad men" of the frontier, with whom
he had often come in contact. "Only
once," he said. The cowboys had always
treated him with the utmost courtesy,
both on the round-up and in camp; "and
the few real desperadoes I have seen were
also perfectly polite." Once only was he
maliciously shot at, and then not by a
cowboy nor a <i>bona fide</i> "bad man," but
by a "broad-hatted ruffian of a cheap and
common-place type." He had been compelled
to pass the night at a little frontier
hotel where the bar-room occupied the
whole lower floor, and was, in consequence,
the only place where the guests of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 55]</a></span>
hotel, whether drunk or sober, could sit.
As he entered the room, he saw that every
man there was being terrorized by a half-drunken
ruffian who stood in the middle
of the floor with a revolver in each hand,
compelling different ones to treat.</p>

<p>"I went and sat down behind the stove,"
said the President, "as far from him as I
could get; and hoped to escape his notice.
The fact that I wore glasses, together
with my evident desire to avoid a fight,
apparently gave him the impression that
I could be imposed upon with impunity.
He very soon approached me, flourishing
his two guns, and ordered me to treat. I
made no reply for some moments, when
the fellow became so threatening that I
saw something had to be done. The
crowd, mostly sheep-herders and small
grangers, sat or stood back against the
wall, afraid to move. I was unarmed,
and thought rapidly. Saying, 'Well, if I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 56]</a></span>
must, I must,' I got up as if to walk around
him to the bar, then, as I got opposite him,
I wheeled and fetched him as heavy a
blow on the chin-point as I could strike.
He went down like a steer before the axe,
firing both guns into the ceiling as he went.
I jumped on him, and, with my knees on
his chest, disarmed him in a hurry. The
crowd was then ready enough to help me,
and we hog-tied him and put him in an
outhouse." The President alludes to this
incident in his "Ranch Life," but does not
give the details. It brings out his mettle
very distinctly.</p>

<p>He told us in an amused way of the
attempts of his political opponents at Albany,
during his early career as a member
of the Assembly, to besmirch his character.
His outspoken criticisms and denunciations
had become intolerable to
them, so they laid a trap for him, but he
was not caught. His innate rectitude and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 57]</a></span>
instinct for the right course saved him,
as it has saved him many times since. I
do not think that in any emergency he has
to debate with himself long as to the right
course to be pursued; he divines it by a
kind of infallible instinct. His motives
are so simple and direct that he finds a
straight and easy course where another
man, whose eye is less single, would flounder
and hesitate.</p>

<p>One night he entertained us with reminiscences
of the Cuban War, of his efforts
to get his men to the firing line when the
fighting began, of his greenness and general
ignorance of the whole business of
war, which in his telling was very amusing.
He has probably put it all in his book
about the war, a work I have not yet read.
He described the look of the slope of Kettle
Hill when they were about to charge up it,
how the grass was combed and rippled by
the storm of rifle bullets that swept down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 58]</a></span>
it. He said, "I was conscious of being
pale when I looked at it and knew that in
a few moments we were going to charge
there." The men of his regiment were all
lying flat upon the ground, and it became
his duty to walk along their front and encourage
them and order them up on their
feet. "Get up, men, get up!" One big
fellow did not rise. Roosevelt stooped
down and took hold of him and ordered
him up. Just at that moment a bullet
struck the man and went the entire length
of him. He never rose.</p>

<p>On this or on another occasion when
a charge was ordered, he found himself a
hundred yards or more in advance of his
regiment, with only the color bearer and
one corporal with him. He said they
planted the flag there, while he rushed
back to fetch the men. He was evidently
pretty hot. "Can it be that you flinched
when I led the way!" and then they came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 59]</a></span>
with a rush. On the summit of Kettle
Hill he was again in advance of his men,
and as he came up, three Spaniards rose
out of the trenches and deliberately fired
at him at a distance of only a few paces,
and then turned and fled. But a bullet
from his revolver stopped one of them.
He seems to have been as much exposed to
bullets in this engagement as Washington
was at Braddock's defeat, and to have
escaped in the same marvelous manner.</p>

<p>The President unites in himself powers
and qualities that rarely go together.
Thus, he has both physical and moral
courage in a degree rare in history. He
can stand calm and unflinching in the
path of a charging grizzly, and he can
confront with equal coolness and determination
the predaceous corporations
and money powers of the country.</p>

<p>He unites the qualities of the man of
action with those of the scholar and writer,&mdash;another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 60]</a></span>
very rare combination. He
unites the instincts and accomplishments
of the best breeding and culture with the
broadest democratic sympathies and affiliations.
He is as happy with a frontiersman
like Seth Bullock as with a fellow
Harvard man, and Seth Bullock is happy,
too.</p>

<p>He unites great austerity with great
good nature. He unites great sensibility
with great force and will power. He loves
solitude, and he loves to be in the thick
of the fight. His love of nature is equaled
only by his love of the ways and marts of
men.</p>

<p>He is doubtless the most vital man on
the continent, if not on the planet, to-day.
He is many-sided, and every side throbs
with his tremendous life and energy; the
pressure is equal all around. His interests
are as keen in natural history as in
economics, in literature as in statecraft,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 61]</a></span>
in the young poet as in the old soldier,
in preserving peace as in preparing for
war. And he can turn all his great power
into the new channel on the instant. His
interest in the whole of life, and in the
whole life of the nation, never flags for a
moment. His activity is tireless. All the
relaxation he needs or craves is a change
of work. He is like the farmer's fields,
that only need a rotation of crops. I
once heard him say that all he cared
about being President was just "the big
work."</p>

<p>During this tour through the West,
lasting over two months, he made nearly
three hundred speeches; and yet on his
return Mrs. Roosevelt told me he looked
as fresh and unworn as when he left home.</p>

<p>We went up into the big geyser region
with the big sleighs, each drawn by four
horses. A big snow-bank had to be shoveled
through for us before we got to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Golden Gate, two miles above Mammoth
Hot Springs. Beyond that we were at an
altitude of about eight thousand feet, on
a fairly level course that led now through
woods, and now through open country,
with the snow of a uniform depth of four
or five feet, except as we neared the "formations,"
where the subterranean warmth
kept the ground bare. The roads had
been broken and the snow packed for us
by teams from the fort, otherwise the
journey would have been impossible.</p>

<p>The President always rode beside the
driver. From his youth, he said, this seat
had always been the most desirable one to
him. When the sleigh would strike the
bare ground, and begin to drag heavily,
he would bound out nimbly and take
to his heels, and then all three of us&mdash;Major
Pitcher, Mr. Childs, and myself&mdash;would
follow suit, sometimes reluctantly
on my part. Walking at that altitude is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 63]</a></span>
no fun, especially if you try to keep pace
with such a walker as the President is.
But he could not sit at his ease and let
those horses drag him in a sleigh over
bare ground. When snow was reached,
we would again quickly resume our seats.</p>

<p>As one nears the geyser region, he gets
the impression from the columns of steam
going up here and there in the distance&mdash;now
from behind a piece of woods, now
from out a hidden valley&mdash;that he is approaching
a manufacturing centre, or a
railroad terminus. And when he begins
to hear the hoarse snoring of "Roaring
Mountain," the illusion is still more complete.
At Norris's there is a big vent
where the steam comes tearing out of a
recent hole in the ground with terrific
force. Huge mounds of ice had formed
from the congealed vapor all around it,
some of them very striking.</p>

<p>The novelty of the geyser region soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 64]</a></span>
wears off. Steam and hot water are steam
and hot water the world over, and the
exhibition of them here did not differ,
except in volume, from what one sees by
his own fireside. The "Growler" is only
a boiling tea-kettle on a large scale, and
"Old Faithful" is as if the lid were to fly
off, and the whole contents of the kettle
should be thrown high into the air. To
be sure, boiling lakes and steaming rivers
are not common, but the new features
seemed, somehow, out of place, and as if
nature had made a mistake. One disliked
to see so much good steam and hot water
going to waste; whole towns might be
warmed by them, and big wheels made
to go round. I wondered that they had
not piped them into the big hotels which
they opened for us, and which were
warmed by wood fires.</p>

</div>

<p>At Norris's the big room that the President
and I occupied was on the ground
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 65]</a></span>
floor, and was heated by a huge box stove.
As we entered it to go to bed, the President
said, "Oom John, don't you think
it is too hot here?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do," I replied.</p>

<p>"Shall I open the window?"</p>

<p>"That will just suit me." And he
threw the sash, which came down to the
floor, all the way up, making an opening
like a doorway. The night was cold, but
neither of us suffered from the abundance
of fresh air.</p>

<p>The caretaker of the building was a
big Swede called Andy. In the morning
Andy said that beat him: "There was
the President of the United States sleeping
in that room, with the window open to the
floor, and not so much as one soldier outside
on guard."</p>

<p>The President had counted much on
seeing the bears that in summer board at
the Fountain Hotel, but they were not yet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 66]</a></span>
out of their dens. We saw the track of
only one, and he was not making for the
hotel. At all the formations where the
geysers are, the ground was bare over a
large area. I even saw a wild flower&mdash;an
early buttercup, not an inch high&mdash;in
bloom. This seems to be the earliest
wild flower in the Rockies. It is the only
fragrant buttercup I know.</p>

<p>As we were riding along in our big
sleigh toward the Fountain Hotel, the
President suddenly jumped out, and,
with his soft hat as a shield to his hand,
captured a mouse that was running along
over the ground near us. He wanted it
for Dr. Merriam, on the chance that it
might be a new species. While we all
went fishing in the afternoon, the President
skinned his mouse, and prepared
the pelt to be sent to Washington. It was
done as neatly as a professed taxidermist
would have done it. This was the only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 67]</a></span>
game the President killed in the Park. In
relating the incident to a reporter while
I was in Spokane, the thought occurred
to me, Suppose he changes that <i>u</i> to an <i>o</i>,
and makes the President capture a moose,
what a pickle I shall be in! Is it anything
more than ordinary newspaper enterprise
to turn a mouse into a moose? But, luckily
for me, no such metamorphosis happened
to that little mouse. It turned out
not to be a new species, as it should have
been, but a species new to the Park.</p>

<p>I caught trout that afternoon, on the
edge of steaming pools in the Madison
River that seemed to my hand almost
blood-warm. I suppose they found better
feeding where the water was warm. On
the table they did not compare with our
Eastern brook trout.</p>

<p>I was pleased to be told at one of the
hotels that they had kalsomined some of
the rooms with material from one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 68]</a></span>
devil's paint-pots. It imparted a soft, delicate,
pinkish tint, not at all suggestive of
things satanic.</p>

<p>One afternoon at Norris's, the President
and I took a walk to observe the
birds. In the grove about the barns there
was a great number, the most attractive
to me being the mountain bluebird. These
birds we saw in all parts of the Park, and
at Norris's there was an unusual number
of them. How blue they were,&mdash;breast
and all! In voice and manner they
were almost identical with our bluebird.
The Western purple finch was abundant
here also, and juncos, and several kinds
of sparrows, with an occasional Western
robin. A pair of wild geese were feeding
in the low, marshy ground not over one
hundred yards from us, but when we
tried to approach nearer they took wing.
A few geese and ducks seem to winter in
the Park.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>The second morning at Norris's one
of our teamsters, George Marvin, suddenly
dropped dead from some heart affection,
just as he had finished caring for
his team. It was a great shock to us all.
I never saw a better man with a team
than he was. I had ridden on the seat
beside him all the day previous. On one
of the "formations" our teams had got
mired in the soft, putty-like mud, and at
one time it looked as if they could never
extricate themselves, and I doubt if they
could have, had it not been for the skill
with which Marvin managed them. We
started for the Grand Ca&ntilde;on up the Yellowstone
that morning, and, in order to
give myself a walk over the crisp snow in
the clear, frosty air, I set out a little while
in advance of the teams. As I did so, I
saw the President, accompanied by one
of the teamsters, walking hurriedly toward
the barn to pay his last respects to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the body of Marvin. After we had returned
to Mammoth Hot Springs, he
made inquiries for the young woman to
whom he had been told that Marvin was
engaged to be married. He looked her
up, and sat a long time with her in her
home, offering his sympathy, and speaking
words of consolation. The act shows
the depth and breadth of his humanity.</p>

<p>At the Ca&ntilde;on Hotel the snow was very
deep, and had become so soft from the
warmth of the earth beneath, as well as
from the sun above, that we could only
reach the brink of the Ca&ntilde;on on skis.
The President and Major Pitcher had
used skis before, but I had not, and,
starting out without the customary pole,
I soon came to grief. The snow gave way
beneath me, and I was soon in an awkward
predicament. The more I struggled,
the lower my head and shoulders went,
till only my heels, strapped to those long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 71]</a></span>
timbers, protruded above the snow. To
reverse my position was impossible till
some one came and reached me the end
of a pole, and pulled me upright. But I
very soon got the hang of the things, and
the President and I quickly left the superintendent
behind. I think I could have
passed the President, but my manners
forbade. He was heavier than I was, and
broke in more. When one of his feet
would go down half a yard or more, I
noted with admiration the skilled diplomacy
he displayed in extricating it. The
tendency of my skis was all the time to
diverge, and each to go off at an acute
angle to my main course, and I had constantly
to be on the alert to check this
tendency.</p>

<p>Paths had been shoveled for us along
the brink of the Ca&ntilde;on, so that we got
the usual views from the different points.
The Ca&ntilde;on was nearly free from snow,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and was a grand spectacle, by far the
grandest to be seen in the Park. The
President told us that once, when pressed
for meat, while returning through here
from one of his hunting trips, he had
made his way down to the river that we
saw rushing along beneath us, and had
caught some trout for dinner. Necessity
alone could induce him to fish.</p>

<p>Across the head of the Falls there was
a bridge of snow and ice, upon which we
were told that the coyotes passed. As the
season progressed, there would come a
day when the bridge would not be safe.
It would be interesting to know if the
coyotes knew when this time arrived.</p>

<p>The only live thing we saw in the
Ca&ntilde;on was an osprey perched upon a
rock opposite us.</p>

</div>

<p>Near the falls of the Yellowstone, as at
other places we had visited, a squad of
soldiers had their winter quarters. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 73]</a></span>
President called on them, as he had called
upon the others, looked over the books
they had to read, examined their housekeeping
arrangements, and conversed
freely with them.</p>

<p>In front of the hotel were some low hills
separated by gentle valleys. At the President's
suggestion, he and I raced on our
skis down those inclines. We had only to
stand up straight, and let gravity do the
rest. As we were going swiftly down
the side of one of the hills, I saw out of
the corner of my eye the President taking
a header into the snow. The snow had
given way beneath him, and nothing
could save him from taking the plunge.
I don't know whether I called out, or
only thought, something about the downfall
of the administration. At any rate,
the administration was down, and pretty
well buried, but it was quickly on its feet
again, shaking off the snow with a boy's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 74]</a></span>
laughter. I kept straight on, and very
soon the laugh was on me, for the treacherous
snow sank beneath me, and I took
a header, too.</p>

<p>"Who is laughing now, Oom John?"
called out the President.</p>

<p>The spirit of the boy was in the air
that day about the Ca&ntilde;on of the Yellowstone,
and the biggest boy of us all was
President Roosevelt.</p>

<p>The snow was getting so soft in the
middle of the day that our return to the
Mammoth Hot Springs could no longer
be delayed. Accordingly, we were up in
the morning, and ready to start on the
home journey, a distance of twenty miles,
by four o'clock. The snow bore up the
horses well till mid-forenoon, when it
began to give way beneath them. But
by very careful management we pulled
through without serious delay, and were
back again at the house of Major Pitcher
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 75]</a></span>
in time for luncheon, being the only outsiders
who had ever made the tour of the
Park so early in the season.</p>

<p>A few days later I bade good-by to the
President, who went on his way to California,
while I made a loop of travel to
Spokane, and around through Idaho and
Montana, and had glimpses of the great,
optimistic, sunshiny West that I shall not
soon forget.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<h2>PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AS A NATURE-LOVER AND OBSERVER</h2>


<p>Our many-sided President has a side
to his nature of which the public has
heard but little, and which, in view of
his recent criticism of what he calls the
nature fakirs, is of especial interest and
importance. I refer to his keenness and
enthusiasm as a student of animal life,
and his extraordinary powers of observation.
The charge recently made against
him that he is only a sportsman and has
only a sportsman's interest in nature is
very wide of the mark. Why, I cannot
now recall that I have ever met a man
with a keener and more comprehensive
interest in the wild life about us&mdash;an
interest that is at once scientific and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 80]</a></span>
thoroughly human. And by human I do
not mean anything akin to the sentimentalism
that sicklies o'er so much of our
more recent natural history writing, and
that inspires the founding of hospitals
for sick cats; but I mean his robust,
manly love for all open-air life, and his
sympathetic insight into it. When I first
read his "Wilderness Hunter," many
years ago, I was impressed by his rare
combination of the sportsman and the
naturalist. When I accompanied him on
his trip to the Yellowstone Park in April,
1903, I got a fresh impression of the extent
of his natural history knowledge and
of his trained powers of observation. Nothing
escaped him, from bears to mice,
from wild geese to chickadees, from elk
to red squirrels; he took it all in, and he
took it in as only an alert, vigorous mind
can take it in. On that occasion I was
able to help him identify only one new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 81]</a></span>
bird, as I have related in the foregoing
chapter. All the other birds he recognized
as quickly as I did.</p>

<p>During a recent half-day spent with
the President at Sagamore Hill I got a
still more vivid impression of his keenness
and quickness in all natural history
matters. The one passion of his life
seemed natural history, and the appearance
of a new warbler in his woods&mdash;new
in the breeding season on Long
Island&mdash;seemed an event that threw the
affairs of state and of the presidential
succession quite into the background.
Indeed, he fairly bubbled over with delight
at the thought of his new birds and
at the prospect of showing them to his
visitors. He said to my friend who accompanied
me, John Lewis Childs, of
Floral Park, a former State Senator, that
he could not talk politics then, he wanted
to talk and to hunt birds. And it was not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 82]</a></span>
long before he was as hot on the trail of
that new warbler as he had recently been
on the trail of some of the great trusts.
Fancy a President of the United States
stalking rapidly across bushy fields to
the woods, eager as a boy and filled with
the one idea of showing to his visitors the
black-throated green warbler! We were
presently in the edge of the woods and
standing under a locust tree, where the
President had several times seen and
heard his rare visitant. "That's his note
now," he said, and we all three recognized
it at the same instant. It came from
across a little valley fifty yards farther in
the woods. We were soon standing under
the tree in which the bird was singing,
and presently had our glasses upon him.</p>

</div>

<p>"There is no mistake about it, Mr.
President," we both said; "it is surely
the black-throated green," and he laughed
in glee. "I knew it could be no other;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 83]</a></span>
there is no mistaking that song and those
markings. 'Trees, trees, murmuring
trees!' some one reports him as saying.
Now if we could only find the nest;" but
we did not, though it was doubtless not
far off.</p>

<p>Our warblers, both in color and in song,
are bewildering even to the experienced
ornithologist, but the President had mastered
most of them. Not long before he
had written me from Washington that he
had just come in from walking with Mrs.
Roosevelt about the White House grounds
looking up arriving warblers. "Most of
the warblers were up in the tops of the
trees, and I could not get a good glimpse
of them; but there was one with chestnut
cheeks, with bright yellow behind the
cheeks, and a yellow breast thickly
streaked with black, which has puzzled
me. Doubtless it is a very common kind
which has for the moment slipped my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 84]</a></span>
memory. I saw the Blackburnian, the
summer yellowbird, and the black-throated
green." The next day he wrote
me that he had identified the puzzling
warbler; it was the Cape May. There is
a tradition among newspaper men in
Washington that a Cape May warbler
once broke up a Cabinet meeting; maybe
this was that identical bird.</p>

<p>At luncheon he told us of some of his
ornithological excursions in the White
House grounds, how people would stare
at him as he stood gazing up into the
trees like one demented. "No doubt
they thought me insane." "Yes," said
Mrs. Roosevelt, "and as I was always
with him, they no doubt thought I was
the nurse that had him in charge."</p>

<p>In his "Pastimes of an American
Hunter" he tells of the owls that in June
sometimes came after nightfall about the
White House. "Sometimes they flew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 85]</a></span>
noiselessly to and fro, and seemingly
caught big insects on the wing. At other
times they would perch on the iron awning
bars directly overhead. Once one of
them perched over one of the windows
and sat motionless, looking exactly like
an owl of Pallas Athene."</p>

<p>He knew the vireos also, and had seen
and heard the white-eyed at his Virginia
place, "Pine Knot," and he described
its peculiar, emphatic song. As I moved
along with the thought of this bird in
mind and its snappy, incisive song, as I
used to hear it in the old days near Washington,
I fancied I caught its note in a
dense bushy place below us. We paused
to listen. "A catbird," said the President,
and so we all agreed. We saw and heard
a chewink. "Out West the chewink calls
like a catbird," he observed. Continuing
our walk, we skirted the edge of an orchard.
Here the President called our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 86]</a></span>
attention to a high-hole's nest in a cavity
of an old apple tree. He rapped on the
trunk of the tree that we might hear the
smothered cry for food of the young inside.
A few days before he had found
one of the half-fledged young on the
ground under the tree, and had managed
to reach up and drop it back into the
nest. "What a boiling there was in there,"
he said, "when the youngster dropped
in!"</p>

<p>A cuckoo called in a tree overhead, the
first I had heard this season. I feared
the cold spring had cut them off. "The
yellow-billed, undoubtedly," the President
observed, and was confirmed by Mr.
Childs. I was not certain that I knew
the call of the yellow-billed from that of
the black-billed. "We have them both,"
said the President, "but the yellow-billed
is the more common."</p>

<p>We continued our walk along a path
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 87]</a></span>
that led down through a most delightful
wood to the bay. Everywhere the marks
of the President's axe were visible, as he
had with his own hand thinned out and
cleared up a large section of the wood.</p>

<p>A few days previous he had seen some
birds in a group of tulip-trees near the
edge of the woods facing the water; he
thought they were rose-breasted grosbeaks,
but could not quite make them
out. He had hoped to find them there
now, and we looked and listened for
some moments, but no birds appeared.</p>

<p>Then he led us to a little pond in the
midst of the forest where the night heron
sometimes nested. A pair of them had
nested there in a big water maple the year
before, but the crows had broken them
up. As we reached the spot the cry of
the heron was heard over the tree-tops.
"That is its alarm note," said the President.
I remarked that it was much like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the cry of the little green heron. "Yes,
it is, but if we wait here till the heron returns,
and we are not discovered, you
would hear his other more characteristic
call, a hoarse quawk."</p>

<p>Presently we moved on along another
path through the woods toward the
house. A large, wide-spreading oak attracted
my attention&mdash;a superb tree.</p>

<p>"You see by the branching of that
oak," said the President, "that when it
grew up this wood was an open field and
maybe under the plough; it is only in fields
that oaks take that form." I knew it was
true, but my mind did not take in the fact
when I first saw the tree. His mind acts
with wonderful swiftness and completeness,
as I had abundant proof that day.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 648px;">

<span class="caption"><big>A BIT OF WOODLAND ON THE SLOPE TOWARDS OYSTER BAY</big><br />
From stereograph, copyright 1907, by Underwood &amp; Underwood, New York</span>
</div>

<p>As we walked along we discussed many
questions, all bearing directly or indirectly
upon natural history. The conversation
was perpetually interrupted by some bird-note
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 89]</a></span>
in the trees about us which we would
pause to identify&mdash;the President's ear,
I thought, being the most alert of the
three. Continuing the talk, he dwelt upon
the inaccuracy of most persons' seeing,
and upon the unreliability as natural
history of most of the stories told by
guides and hunters. Sometimes writers
of repute were to be read with caution.
He mentioned that excellent hunting
book of Colonel Dodge's, in which are
described two species of the puma, one
in the West called the "mountain lion,"
very fierce and dangerous; the other called
in the East the "panther,"&mdash;a harmless
and cowardly animal. "Both the same
species," said the President, "and almost
identical in disposition."</p>

<p>Nothing is harder than to convince a
person that he has seen wrongly. The
other day a doctor accosted me in the
street of one of our inland towns to tell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 90]</a></span>
me of a strange bird he had seen; the
bird was blood-red all over and was in
some low bushes by the roadside. Of
course I thought of our scarlet tanager,
which was then just arriving. No, he
knew that bird with black wings and tail;
this bird had no black upon it, but every
quill and feather was vivid scarlet. The
doctor was very positive, so I had to tell
him we had no such bird in our state.
There was the summer redbird common
in the Southern States, but this place is
much beyond its northern limit, and, besides,
this bird is not scarlet, but is of a
dull red. Of course he had seen a tanager,
but in the shade of the bushes the
black of the wings and tail had escaped
him.</p>

<p>This was simply a case of mis-seeing
in an educated man; but in the untrained
minds of trappers and woodsmen generally
there is an element of the superstitious,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 91]</a></span>
and a love for the marvelous, which
often prevents them from seeing the wild
life about them just as it is. They possess
the mythop[oe]ic faculty, and they
unconsciously give play to it.</p>

<p>Thus our talk wandered as we wandered
along the woods and field paths.
The President brought us back by the
corner of a clover meadow where he was
sure a pair of red-shouldered starlings
had a nest. He knew it was an unlikely
place for starlings to nest, as they breed
in marshes and along streams and in the
low bushes on lake borders, but this pair
had always shown great uneasiness when
he had approached this plot of tall clover.
As we drew near, the male starling appeared
and uttered his alarm note. The
President struck out to look for the nest,
and for a time the Administration was
indeed in clover, with the alarmed black-bird
circling above it and showing great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 92]</a></span>
agitation. For my part, I hesitated on the
edge of the clover patch, having a farmer's
dread of seeing fine grass trampled down.
I suggested to the President that he was
injuring his hay crop; that the nest
was undoubtedly there or near there; so
he came out of the tall grass, and, after
looking into the old tumbled-down barn&mdash;a
regular early settler's barn, with
huge timbers hewn from forest trees&mdash;that
stood near by, and which the President
said he preserved for its picturesqueness
and its savor of old times, as well as
for a place to romp in with his dogs and
children, we made our way to the house.</p>

<p>The purple finch nested in the trees
about the house, and the President was
greatly pleased that he was able to show
us this bird also.</p>

<span class="caption"><big>A PATH IN THE WOODS LEADING TO COLD SPRING HARBOR</big><br />
From stereograph, copyright 1907, by Underwood &amp; Underwood, New York</span>
</div>

<p>A few days previous to our visit the
children had found a bird's nest on the
ground, in the grass, a few yards below
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the front of the house. There were young
birds in it, and as the President had seen
the grasshopper sparrow about there, he
concluded the nest belonged to it. We
went down to investigate it, and found
the young gone and two addled eggs in
the nest. When the President saw those
eggs, he said: "That is not the nest of the
grasshopper sparrow, after all; those are
the eggs of the song sparrow, though
the nest is more like that of the vesper
sparrow. The eggs of the grasshopper
sparrow are much lighter in color&mdash;almost
white, with brown specks." For
my part, I had quite forgotten for the
moment how the eggs of the little sparrow
looked or differed in color from those of
the song sparrow. But the President has
so little to remember that he forgets none
of these minor things! His bird-lore
and wood-lore seem as fresh as if just
learned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>I asked him if he ever heard that rare
piece of bird music, the flight song of the
oven-bird. "Yes," he replied, "we frequently
hear it of an evening, while we
are sitting on the porch, right down there
at the corner of the woods." Now, this
flight song of the oven-bird was unknown
to the older ornithologists, and Thoreau,
with all his years of patient and tireless
watching of birds and plants, never identified
it; but the President had caught it
quickly and easily, sitting on his porch
at Sagamore Hill. I believe I may take
the credit of being the first to identify
and describe this song&mdash;back in the old
"Wake Robin" days.</p>

<p>In an inscription in a book the President
had just given me he had referred
to himself as my pupil. Now I was to be
his pupil. In dealing with the birds I
could keep pace with him pretty easily,
and, maybe, occasionally lead him; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 95]</a></span>
when we came to consider big game and
the animal life of the globe, I was nowhere.
His experience with the big game
has been very extensive, and his acquaintance
with the literature of the subject is
far beyond my own; and he forgets nothing,
while my memory is a sieve. In
his study he set before me a small bronze
elephant in action, made by the famous
French sculptor Barye. He asked me if I
saw anything wrong with it. I looked it
over carefully, and was obliged to confess
that, so far as I could see, it was all right.
Then he placed before me another, by a
Japanese artist. Instantly I saw what was
wrong with the Frenchman's elephant.
Its action was like that of a horse or a
cow, or any trotting animal&mdash;a hind
and a front foot on opposite sides moving
together. The Japanese had caught
the real movement of the animal, which
is that of a pacer&mdash;both legs on the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 96]</a></span>
side at a time. What different effects the
two actions gave the statuettes! The free
swing of the Japanese elephant you at
once recognize as the real thing. The
President laughed, and said he had never
seen any criticism of Barye's elephant on
this ground, or any allusion to his mistake;
it was his own discovery. I was fairly
beaten at my own game of observation.</p>

<p>He then took down a copy of his
"Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail,"
and pointed out to me the mistakes the
artist had made in some of his drawings
of big Western game.</p>

<p>"Do you see anything wrong in the
head of the pronghorn?" he asked, referring
to the animal which the hunter is
bringing in on the saddle behind him.
Again I had to confess that I could not.
Then he showed me the mounted head
of a pronghorn over the mantel in one of
his rooms, and called my attention to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 97]</a></span>
fact that the eye was close under the root
of the horn, whereas in the picture the
artist had placed it about two inches too
low. And in the artist's picture of the
pronghorn, which heads Chapter IX, he
had made the tail much too long, as he
had the tail of the elk on the opposite
page.</p>

<p>I had heard of Mr. Roosevelt's attending
a fair in Orange County, while he
was Governor, where a group of mounted
deer were exhibited. It seems the group
had had rough usage, and one of the deer
had lost its tail and a new one had been
supplied. No one had noticed anything
wrong with it till Mr. Roosevelt came
along. "But the minute he clapped his
eyes on that group," says the exhibitor,
"he called out, 'Here, Gunther, what do
you mean by putting a white-tail deer's
tail on a black-tail deer?" Such closeness
and accuracy of observation even few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 98]</a></span>
naturalists can lay claim to. I mentioned
the incident to him, and he recalled it
laughingly. He then took down a volume
on the deer family which he had himself
had a share in writing, and pointed out
two mistakes in the naming of the pictures
which had been overlooked. The
picture of the "white-tail in flight" was
the black-tail of Colorado, and the picture
of the black-tail of Colorado showed the
black-tail of Columbia&mdash;the difference
this time being seen in the branching of
the horns.</p>

<p>The President took us through his
house and showed us his trophies of the
chase&mdash;bearskins of all sorts and sizes
on the floors, panther and lynx skins on
the chairs, and elk heads and deer heads
on the walls, and one very large skin of
the gray timber wolf. We examined the
teeth of the wolf, barely more than an
inch long, and we all laughed at the idea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of its reaching the heart of a caribou
through the breast by a snap, or any
number of snaps, as it has been reported
to do. I doubt if it could have reached
the heart of a gobbler turkey in that way
at a single snap.</p>

<span class="caption"><big>A YEARLING IN THE APPLE ORCHARD</big><br />

</div>

<p>The President's interest in birds, and
in natural history generally, dates from
his youth. While yet in his teens he published
a list of the birds of Franklin
County, New York. He showed me a
bird journal which he kept in Egypt
when he was a lad of fourteen, and a
case of three African plovers which he
had set up at that time; and they were
well done.</p>

<p>Evidently one of his chief sources of
pleasure at Sagamore Hill is the companionship
of the birds. He missed the
bobolink, the seaside finch, and the
marsh wren, but his woods and grounds
abounded in other species. He knew and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 100]</a></span>
enjoyed not only all the more common
birds, but many rarer and shyer ones
that few country people ever take note
of&mdash;such as the Maryland yellow-throat,
the black and white creeper, the yellow-breasted
chat, the oven-bird, the prairie
warbler, the great crested flycatcher, the
wood pewee, and the sharp-tailed finch.
He enjoyed the little owls, too. "It is a
pity the little-eared owl is called a screech
owl. Its tremulous, quavering cry is not
a screech at all, and has an attraction of
its own. These little owls come up to the
house after dark, and are fond of sitting
on the elk's antlers over the gable. When
the moon is up, by choosing one's position,
the little owl appears in sharp outline
against the bright disk, seated on his
many-tined perch."</p>

<p>A few days after my visit he wrote me
that he had identified the yellow-throated
or Dominican warbler in his woods, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 101]</a></span>
first he had ever seen. I had to confess
to him that I had never seen the bird. It
is very rare north of Maryland. The
same letter records several interesting
little incidents in the wild life about him:</p>

<p>"The other night I took out the boys
in rowboats for a camping-out expedition.
We camped on the beach under a
low bluff near the grove where a few
years ago on a similar expedition we saw
a red fox. This time two young foxes,
evidently this year's cubs, came around
the camp half a dozen times during the
night, coming up within ten yards of the
fire to pick up scraps and seeming to be
very little bothered by our presence. Yesterday
on the tennis ground I found a
mole shrew. He was near the side lines
first. I picked him up in my handkerchief,
for he bit my hand, and after we
had all looked at him I let him go; but
in a few minutes he came back and deliberately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 102]</a></span>
crossed the tennis grounds by the
net. As he ran over the level floor of the
court, his motion reminded all of us of
the motion of those mechanical mice that
run around on wheels when wound up.
A chipmunk that lives near the tennis
court continually crosses it when the
game is in progress. He has done it two
or three times this year, and either he or
his predecessor has had the same habit
for several years. I am really puzzled
to know why he should go across this
perfectly bare surface, with the players
jumping about on it, when he is not
frightened and has no reason that I can
see for going. Apparently he grows accustomed
to the players and moves about
among them as he would move about, for
instance, among a herd of cattle."</p>

<p>The President is a born nature-lover,
and he has what does not always go with
this passion&mdash;remarkable powers of observation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 103]</a></span>
He sees quickly and surely,
not less so with the corporeal eye than
with the mental. His exceptional vitality,
his awareness all around, gives the
clue to his powers of seeing. The chief
qualification of a born observer is an
alert, sensitive, objective type of mind,
and this Roosevelt has in a pre&euml;minent
degree.</p>

<p>You may know the true observer, not
by the big things he sees, but by the
little things; and then not by the things
he sees with effort and premeditation, but
by his effortless, unpremeditated seeing&mdash;the
quick, spontaneous action of his mind
in the presence of natural objects. Everybody
sees the big things, and anybody can
go out with note-book and opera-glass and
make a dead set at the birds, or can go
into the northern forests and interview
guides and trappers and Indians, and
stare in at the door of the "school of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 104]</a></span>
woods." None of these things evince
powers of observation; they only evince
industry and intention. In fact, born observers
are about as rare as born poets.
Plenty of men can see straight and report
straight what they see; but the men who
see what others miss, who see quickly
and surely, who have the detective eye,
like Sherlock Holmes, who "get the
drop," so to speak, on every object, who
see minutely and who see whole, are rare
indeed.</p>

<p>President Roosevelt comes as near
fulfilling this ideal as any man I have
known. His mind moves with wonderful
celerity, and yet as an observer he is
very cautious, jumps to no hasty conclusions.</p>

<p>He had written me, toward the end of
May, that while at Pine Knot in Virginia
he had seen a small flock of passenger
pigeons. As I had been following
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 105]</a></span>
up the reports of wild pigeons from various
parts of our own state during the
past two or three years, this statement of
the President's made me prick up my
ears. In my reply I said, "I hope you are
sure about those pigeons," and I told
him of my interest in the subject, and
also how all reports of pigeons in the
East had been discredited by a man in
Michigan who was writing a book on the
subject. This made him prick up his
ears, and he replied that while he felt very
certain he had seen a small band of the
old wild pigeons, yet he might have been
deceived; the eye sometimes plays one
tricks. He said that in his old ranch days
he and a cowboy companion thought one
day that they had discovered a colony of
<i>black</i> prairie dogs, thanks entirely to the
peculiar angle at which the light struck
them. He said that while he was President
he did not want to make any statement,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 106]</a></span>
even about pigeons, for the truth
of which he did not have good evidence.
He would have the matter looked into by
a friend at Pine Knot upon whom he
could depend. He did so, and convinced
himself and me also that he had really
seen wild pigeons. I had the pleasure of
telling him that in the same mail with
his letter came the news to me of a large
flock of wild pigeons having been seen
near the Beaverkill in Sullivan County,
New York. While he was verifying his
observation I was in Sullivan County
verifying this report. I saw and questioned
persons who had seen the pigeons,
and I came away fully convinced that a
flock of probably a thousand birds had
been seen there late in the afternoon of
May 23. "You need have no doubt
about it," said the most competent
witness, an old farmer. "I lived here
when the pigeons nested here in countless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 107]</a></span>
numbers forty years ago. I know
pigeons as I know folks, and these were
pigeons."</p>

</div>

<p>I mention this incident of the pigeons
because I know that the fact that they
have been lately seen in considerable
numbers will be good news to a large
number of readers.</p>

<p>The President's nature-love is deep
and abiding. Not every bird student
succeeds in making the birds a part of
his life. Not till you have long and sympathetic
intercourse with them, in fact,
not till you have loved them for their own
sake, do they enter into and become a
part of your life. I could quote many
passages from President Roosevelt's
books which show how he has felt and
loved the birds, and how discriminating
his ear is with regard to their songs. Here
is one:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The meadow-lark is a singer of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 108]</a></span>
higher order [than the plains skylark],
deserving to rank with the best. Its song
has length, variety, power, and rich melody,
and there is in it sometimes a cadence
of wild sadness inexpressibly touching.
Yet I cannot say that either song
would appeal to others as it appeals to me;
for to me it comes forever laden with a
hundred memories and associations&mdash;with
the sight of dim hills reddening in
the dawn, with the breath of cool morning
winds blowing across lonely plains,
with the scent of flowers on the sunlit
prairie, with the motion of fiery horses,
with all the strong thrill of eager and
buoyant life. I doubt if any man can
judge dispassionately the bird-songs of
his own country; he cannot disassociate
them from the sights and sounds of the
land that is so dear to him."</p>

<p>Here is another, touching upon some
European song-birds as compared with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 109]</a></span>
some of our own: "No one can help liking
the lark; it is such a brave, honest,
cheery bird, and moreover its song is uttered
in the air, and is very long-sustained.
But it is by no means a musician of the
first rank. The nightingale is a performer
of a very different and far higher order;
yet though it is indeed a notable and
admirable singer, it is an exaggeration
to call it unequaled. In melody, and
above all in that finer, higher melody
where the chords vibrate with the touch
of eternal sorrow, it cannot rank with
such singers as the wood-thrush and
the hermit-thrush. The serene ethereal
beauty of the hermit's song, rising and
falling through the still evening, under
the archways of hoary mountain forests
that have endured from time everlasting;
the golden, leisurely chiming of the wood-thrush,
sounding on June afternoons,
stanza by stanza, through the sun-flecked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 110]</a></span>
groves of tall hickories, oaks, and chestnuts;
with these there is nothing in the
nightingale's song to compare. But in
volume and continuity, in tuneful, voluble,
rapid outpouring and ardor, above
all in skillful and intricate variation of
theme, its song far surpasses that of
either of the thrushes. In all these respects
it is more just to compare it with
the mocking-bird's, which, as a rule, likewise
falls short precisely on those points
where the songs of the two thrushes
excel."</p>

<p>In his "Pastimes of an American
Hunter" he says: "It is an incalculable
added pleasure to any one's sense of happiness
if he or she grows to know, even
slightly and imperfectly, how to read and
enjoy the wonder-book of nature. All
hunters should be nature-lovers. It is to
be hoped that the days of mere wasteful,
boastful slaughter are past, and that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 111]</a></span>
from now on the hunter will stand foremost
in working for the preservation and
perpetuation of the wild life, whether big
or little." Surely this man is the rarest
kind of a sportsman.</p>
